#### General guidelines

**Adding a resource:**
- With rare exceptions, any pull request that adds a new library, tool, or service to the Code page will be accepted.
- Any library should include a few paragraphs describing the usage and offering people a chance to grok the project priorities.
- If there isn't a section already for your programming language, please add it. 

**Removing a resource:**
- Services that don't work anymore
- Code repositories that are archived
- Projects declared to be abandoned by their maintainers

We rely on these concrete signals before removing a resource. Even if a project hasn't been released in a few years, that doesn't mean that it's not working.
